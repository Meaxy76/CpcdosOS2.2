DJASM User's Guide
******************

`djasm' is a special-purpose 16-bit assembler used to compile the
16-bit stub that allows DOS to run the COFF files generated by DJGPP.

   This is Edition 1.05 of the documentation for `djasm', `The DJGPP
16-bit Assembler', last updated June 2001, for DJGPP version
2.04.  This manual incorporates the information in Bill Currie's LyX
documentation for `djasm', dated 19 November 1999.

1.1 Disclaimer
==============

     This is an UNREVIEWED and UNGUARANTEED document describing *some*
     of the aspects of djasm.  We think it might describe djasm, but
     then it might not.
                                                                   --DJ

Some features described herein may be specific to Bill Currie's latest
version of `djasm', available at `www.taniwha.org', and may not (yet)
have found their way into the official DJGPP release.  The final
authority regarding `djasm' is the Bison source file `djasm.y' in the
archive `djlsrNNN.zip'.

1.2 Description
===============

`djasm' is a restricted assembler that was developed for a single
purpose: to compile the 16-bit startup stub that is prepended to all
DJGPP-built executables.  The purpose of the stub is to (i) check for
DPMI services, (ii) load CWSDPMI if another DPMI server is not found,
(iii) switch into protected mode, and (iv) load and execute a
DJGPP-generated COFF image.  With `djasm' the DJGPP distribution can be
made completely self-contained; you don't need commercial (or otherwise
non-DJGPP) 16-bit tools to build any part of the DJGPP distribution.

   Be aware, however, that although `djasm' can be used in other
applications, it is _not_ a full-featured assembler; if you need a
sophisticated, general-purpose assembler then consider using AS (the
GNU assembler) or NASM (the Netwide Assembler).  Give some thought to
what you want to do, and choose the right tool for the job.  The GNU
assembler AS (`as.exe') is part of the DJGPP `bnuNNNb.zip' archive and
should be available in the `bin' subdirectory of your DJGPP tree (i.e.,
in `$DJDIR/bin') if you have installed GCC.  The Netwide Assembler NASM
lives at `www.cryogen.com/Nasm'.

1.3 A Brief History of `djasm'
==============================

The need for `djasm' arose when Cygnus, a major user of DJGPP for their
DOS-based products, requested a version of DJGPP that was fully
independent and self-bootstrapping.  The existing DJGPP 1.x system
didn't entirely meet their need, however, because a Borland 16-bit
compiler (Turbo C 2.0) was required to build the `go32.exe' program
used by DJGPP 1.x.

   The first task, therefore, in making a version 2.x of DJGPP that
would be entirely self-contained was to write an assembler that could
compile the 16-bit stub required by all DJGPP executables.  The stub
could have been written to use NASM, but (1) NASM wasn't around at the
time, and (2) a dedicated 16-bit compiler would make DJGPP independent
of any other product.  Thus `djasm' was designed and written for a
specific purpose--to compile the 16-bit code for DJGPP's startup stub
and enable _everything_ needed to build DJGPP to be distributed freely.

   The `djasm' compiler was to have no other purpose in life, and was
never intended to be a generic utility, until some of the developers got
carried away and introduced support for many additional opcodes that had
not yet been used.  As a result, `djasm' has become sufficiently
powerful to be useful for more 16-bit applications than just the DJGPP
stub.

2.1 What `djasm' can do
=======================

Despite its limitations, `djasm' does have some nice features:

   * The syntax was designed to be easy to parse, so `djasm' is
     relatively easy to learn and use, and code written for `djasm'
     tends to be straightforward.

   * `djasm' is released under the terms of the GPL and comes with
     DJGPP (`djdevNNN.zip').

   * GCC- and AS-generated COFF files can be linked with the code (the
     linking is done by `djasm').

   * `djasm' produces 16-bit code (currently this is the only available
     mode).

   * There is support for several output formats, including raw hex
     output for subsequent use with assembler and C code.

   * C-style structure, union, and enumeration types are supported.

   * Most instructions and addressing modes are supported.

   * Full 32-bit addressing.

2.2 Differences between `djasm' and other assemblers
====================================================

There are some important differences between `djasm' and other
assemblers, such as NASM or the GNU assembler AS.

   * Like most assemblers, `djasm' has its own syntactic idiosyncrasies.
     In general, `djasm' syntax is similar to Intel syntax, and porting
     code to `djasm' shouldn't be difficult.

   * `djasm' generates 16-bit code, AS generates 32-bit code, and NASM
     can generate both 16- and 32-bit code.

   * `djasm' is incompletely documented and has incomplete opcode
     support; AS and NASM are fully supported.

   * `djasm' does not support macros.

   * `djasm' is restricted in its output formats.

   * `djasm' does not support multi-file programs, so all source must
     be in a single file.

   * `djasm' builds `.exe' and other executables directly; there is no
     linker.

   * Code generated by `djasm' cannot be linked with DJGPP programs;
     both NASM and the GNU assembler AS can produce standard COFF
     objects.  However, `djasm' *can* build a raw binary image for
     inclusion in other code.

2.3 What's missing from `djasm'?
================================

Although `djasm' can do quite a bit as it stands, there are a number of
things that experienced assembly-language programmers will miss.
Future versions of `djasm' may add support for some or all of these
items, but again, if you need a sophisticated general-purpose
assembler, you should consider AS or NASM.

   * Complete instruction set support.

   * Object files--what format(s)?

   * A companion 16-bit linker.

   * Segments.  (Is this really necessary?  Is it worth it?  Should one
     just use NASM instead?)

   * Macros.

   * More documentation.

   * Finish support for the Tool Interface Standards (TIS) Relocatable
     Object Module Format (OMF).

   * Better symbol handling (allow forward references in most
     expressions).

   * Better section support.  At first, just being able to swap between
     the `.text', `.data', and `.bss' sections at will.  Later, maybe
     `real' segment support (especially 16/32-bit control).

   * Finalize instruction support for 486.

   * Pentium* instructions.

2.4 When would I want to use `djasm'?
=====================================

Ordinarily, assembly language programmers should use AS, or a 16/32-bit
assembler like NASM, for most programming purposes.  However, there are
a few reasons why you might want to use `djasm':

   * If you are looking for a free (sensu GPL) 16-bit assembler.

   * To keep a project compatible with the spirit of DJGPP, without
     requiring the use of NASM or some other assembler to compile
     16-bit code.

   * For small 16-bit projects, such as device drivers, TSRs, boot
     loaders, or micro-kernels.

3 Invoking `djasm'
******************

Invoke `djasm' as follows:

     djasm INFILE [OUTFILE] [MAPFILE]

where OUTFILE defaults to `INFILE.exe' after dropping the extension
from INFILE, and MAPFILE defaults to `INFILE.map' after dropping the
extension from INFILE.

   The extension of `outfile' determines the format of the generated
code.  The following output formats are supported:

`.exe'
     Generate a normal DOS `.exe' executable (MZ-signature).  Does not
     support more than one segment.  This is the only output format
     that supports the `.copyright' directive.

`.com'
     Generate a normal DOS `.com' file.  Program offset is at 0x100.

`.bin'
`.sys'
     Generate binary files starting at offset 0.  The `.sys' format is
     supported so that device drivers can be built directly (i.e.,
     without needing to rename a `.bin' output file to a `.sys' file).

`.h'
     Produce a C-compilable array of bytes (without type declaration or
     surrounding {}s).

`.inc'
     Produce a `.db' array for other `djasm' `.asm' files.

`.ah'
     Produce a `.byte' array for AS `.s' or `.S' files.

   For the `.h', `.inc', and `.ah' output types, the `.type' directive
is used to determine which binary type to emit (*note .type: General.).

File: djasm.info,  Node: Syntax,  Next: General,  Up: Language

4.1 Assembler Syntax
====================

As a general rule, `djasm' uses the same ordering of operands, and
usually the same instruction names, as do TASM and MASM.

   For ambiguous operand sizes, `djasm' uses operand suffixes instead
of the `word ptr', etc., operand modifiers used by other 16-bit
assemblers.  For example, `djasm' uses `cmpb' instead of `cmp byte'.

   Until documentation for `djasm' is completed, however, you should
examine the `bison' source for `djasm' (in the file `djasm.y') to learn
exactly what the instruction mnemonics and their arguments are.


File: djasm.info,  Node: General,  Next: Data,  Prev: Syntax,  Up: Language

4.2 General Directives
======================

`.align'
     Usage:  .align BOUNDARY [, FILL]

     Emit bytes (if necessary) so that the program counter CS:IP
     (denoted by `.') is a multiple of BOUNDARY (i.e., such that CS:IP
     % BOUNDARY == 0).  The argument FILL specifies what bytes to emit;
     the default is 0x90 (NOP).

          .align 4       ; align on a 4-byte boundary, pad using 0x90
          .align 16,0    ; align on a 16-byte boundary, pad using 0x00

`.bss'
     Usage:  .bss

     Signifies the end of generated bytes.  No more bytes will be
     emitted into the image, but space will be reserved so labels can
     be declared after this point to create uninitialized variables.

`.copyright'
     Usage:  .copyright STRING

     Inserts the copyright message STRING into the header of the
     executable, starting approximately at offset 0x61 (there is also
     some text with the generation details of the file starting at
     offset 0x28).  STRING is a standard C string.  Multiple
     `.copyright' directives concatenate.  This directive is currently
     supported only for the `.exe' output format.

`.id'
     Usage:  .id

     Emit SCCS and RCS identification strings into the instruction
     stream.  These strings have the form:

          $Id: djasm.lyx,v 1.2 1999/06/22 07:08:56 bill Exp $
          @(#) foo.asm built 10/04/97 14:03:30 by djasm

`.include'
     Usage:  .include "FILE.inc"

     Include a text file for assembly.  `djasm' pushes the current file
     location, starts processing the included file, then pops the old
     location when the end of the included file is reached.  No path
     searching is performed to find the `.include'ed file, but FILE.inc
     itself can include a path specification.

`.linkcoff'
     Usage:  .linkcoff "FILE.o"

     Link in an AS-generated 32-bit COFF file (e.g., the output from
     `gcc -c foo.c').  Currently supports only i386 COFF files with
     `.text', `.data', and `.bss' sections; these _must_ be the first
     three sections in the COFF file and _must_ appear in that order.
     Any other sections will be ignored.  These three sections will be
     placed into the output image in the same order as in the COFF file.
     The `.bss' section of the COFF file will be placed into the output
     image by emitting the appropriate number of zeros--this means that
     the `.bss' section from the COFF file will occupy space in the
     output image rather than being implicit.

     As with `.include', no path searching is done for `.linkcoff', but
     FILE.o itself can include a path specification.

`.org'
     Usage:  .org OFFSET

     Sets the instruction pointer IP to OFFSET.  The IP can only be
     increased using `.org', never decreased.

`.stack'
     Usage:  .stack

     For `.exe' files only, sets the initial value of the stack pointer
     SP to the current value of the instruction pointer IP.

`.start'
     Usage:  .start

     For `.exe' files only, sets the initial value of the instruction
     pointer IP to the current value of the program counter CS:IP.

`.type'
     Usage:  .type "IMAGE"

     where IMAGE is one of `com', `bin', `sys', `h', `inc', or `ah'.
     The following table summarizes the effect of various combinations
     of output file extension and `.type' declaration.

     +---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
     | Output  | Value of `.type'                                    |
     |  file   +-----------------------------------------------------+
     |extension| exe     com     bin     sys(b)  h       inc     ah  |
     +---------+-----------------------------------------------------+
     |  exe(c) | exe     exe(a)  exe     exe     exe     exe     exe |
     |  com    | ---     com     ---     ---     ---     ---     --- |
     |  bin    | bin     bin(a)  bin     bin     bin     bin     bin |
     |  sys(b) | bin     bin(a)  bin     bin     bin     bin     bin |
     |  h      | exe     com     bin     bin     exe     bin     bin |
     |  inc    | exe     com     bin     bin     exe     bin     bin |
     |  ah     | exe     com     bin     bin     exe     bin     bin |
     +---------+-----------------------------------------------------+

       a. The first 0x100 bytes of the program are 0x90 (NOP), followed
          by the generated code.

       b. The `.sys' type is a synonym for `.bin'.

       c. `.exe' is the default output file extension if no output file
          (or output file extension) is specified.

4.3 Data Directives
===================

The data directives are used to reserve space for byte (8-bit), word
(16-bit), and double word (32-bit) data.  The allocated space may be
initialized or left indeterminate.  The general syntax of the data
allocation directives is:

     .db [dblist [','dblist...]]
     .dw [dwlist [','dwlist...]]
     .dd [ddlist [','ddlist...]]

`.db'
     Define a byte of data.

`.dd'
     Define a word of data.

`.dw'
     Define a double word of data.

`.dblist'
`.dwlist'
`.ddlist'
     List of byte, word, or double word data.


   The data lists `dblist', `dwlist', and `ddlist' are constructed from
the following :

`constant'
     A decimal (e.g., 144), hexadecimal (e.g., 0x90), or character
     (e.g., 'A') constant.

`string'
     A C-style string constant, e.g., `"This is a string."'.

`UID offset'
     This item is available only for the `dwlist' and `ddlist'
     directives.

`const .dup const'
     Repeat a block of data.


File: djasm.info,  Node: Structures,  Next: Prefixes,  Prev: Data,  Up: Language

4.4 Structures
==============

The following directives provide support for C-style `struct', `union',
and `enum' constructs.

`.struct'
     Start a structure.

`.union'
     Start a union.

`.enum'
     Define an enumeration type.

`.ends'
     End a structure, union, or enumeration.


* Menu:

* Structures and Unions::       Using structures and unions.
* Enumerations::                Using enumerations.


File: djasm.info,  Node: Structures and Unions,  Next: Enumerations,  Up: Structures

4.4.1 Structures and Unions
---------------------------

In their usage, `.struct' is the same as `struct' in C, and `.union' is
the same as `union' in C.  For example, the construct

     .struct FARPTR
             off     .dw
             seg     .dw
     .ends

defines the following symbols:

     FARPTR     = 4          ; size of the `FARPTR' structure
     FARPTR.off = 0          ; offset of `off' in the `FARPTR' structure
     FARPTR.seg = 2          ; offset of `seg' in the `FARPTR' structure

   If, in the above example, the `.union' directive had been used
instead of `.struct', a union would have been defined, capable of
holding an offset or a segment, but not both--thus the construct

     .union FARPTR
            off      .dw
            seg      .dw
     .ends

defines the following symbols:

     FARPTR     = 2          ; size of the `FARPTR' union
     FARPTR.off = 0          ; offset of `off' in the `FARPTR' union
     FARPTR.seg = 0          ; offset of `seg' in the `FARPTR' union

   Nested structures are supported.  Here is an example of a nested
structure `XMS_MOVE' that uses the `FARPTR' structure from the previous
example:

     .struct XMS_MOVE
             length          .dd
             src_handle      .dw
             src_offset      .struct FARPTR
             dst_handle      .dw
             dst_offset      .struct FARPTR
     .ends

This construct defines the following symbols and offsets (the members
of each structure have been indented to illustrate the nesting, and the
size in bytes of each member is given in brackets):

     XMS_MOVE                    = 16        ; size of the XMS_MOVE structure
     XMS_MOVE.length             =  0  [4]
     XMS_MOVE.src_handle         =  4  [2]
       XMS_MOVE.src_offset       =  6
       XMS_MOVE.src_offset.off   =  6  [2]
       XMS_MOVE.src_offset.seg   =  8  [2]
     XMS_MOVE.dst_handle         = 10  [2]
       XMS_MOVE.dst_offset       = 12
       XMS_MOVE.dst_offset.off   = 12  [2]
       XMS_MOVE.dst_offset.seg   = 14  [2]

   Note that `XMS_MOVE.src_offset' and `XMS_MOVE.src_offset.off' share
the same offset, as do `XMS_MOVE.dst_offset' and
`XMS_MOVE.dst_offset.off'--this is so that the offset of the nested
structure or union can be used directly.

   When declaring the members of a structure or union, `.struct' and
`.union' can be used interchangably without changing the resulting
layout of the final construct.  In other words, `.struct' could be used
when defining unions and `.union' can be used when defining structures.
This practice is confusing and is *not* recommended; the appropriate
directive should always be used, but this is not enforced (mostly
because there is no way of detecting it).

   Variables can be declared to be structures or unions.  For example,
the statement

     xms_move_packet .struct XMS_MOVE

has the same effect as

     xms_move_packet:
             xms_move_packet.length:
             .dd 0
             xms_move_packet.src_handle:
             .dw 0
     xms_move_packet.src_offset:
             xms_move_packet.src_offset.off:
             .dw 0
             xms_move_packet.src_offset.seg:
             .dw 0
             xms_move_packet.dst_handle:
             .dw 0
     xms_move_packet.dst_offset:
             xms_move_packet.dst_offset.off:
             .dw 0
             xms_move_packet.dst_offset.seg:
             .dw 0

   It is sometimes desirable to place the structure at a specified
location.  For this purpose, any valid expression using defined symbols
is allowed, not just `.token' or `.token-symbol'.  For example, the
following two lines

     xms_move_packet .struct XMS_MOVE (.) ; doesn't emit any bytes!
     xms_move_packet .struct XMS_MOVE (.-sh_handle_cache)

have the same effect as `X'=`.' or `X'=`.-sh_handle_cache', respectively
(recall that `.' denotes the current program counter), and generate the
following structure:

     xms_move_packet                = X
     xms_move_packet.length         = X
     xms_move_packet.src_handle     = X +  4
     xms_move_packet.src_offset     = X +  6
     xms_move_packet.src_offset.off = X +  6
     xms_move_packet.src_offset.seg = X +  8
     xms_move_packet.dst_handle     = X + 10
     xms_move_packet.dst_offset     = X + 12
     xms_move_packet.dst_offset.off = X + 12
     xms_move_packet.dst_offset.seg = X + 14

   The `(.)' form is useful for initializing structures--just follow
the declaration line by anonymous `.db' or `.dw' or `.dd' lines.
Unfortunately this is prone to error, but it is currently the only way
of doing this.  Any expression that `djasm' can handle as a relocation
is permitted in the parentheses; this can be useful for declaring
structures at some specific address (e.g., the PSP structure or some of
the DOS system tables).

4.4.2 Enumerations
------------------

The enumeration type allows arbitrary mnemonic identifiers (the
"enumeration constants") to be mapped to a set of integer values.  The
classical textbook example is that of defining a boolean variable.  The
following construct defines `boolean' as an enumeration type that can
take the values 0 (`false') or 1 (`true').

     .enum   boolean
             false
             true
     .ends

In this example, `pets' is defined to be an enumeration type having
integral values 0 (`bird'), 1 (`cat'), 2 (`dog'), or 3 (`rock').

     .enum   pets
             bird
             cat
             dog
             rock
     .ends

In a `djasm' program the above enumeration types could be referenced as
follows:

     .start
             nop
             mov     ax,true                 ; ax <- 1
             mov     bx,pets.dog             ; bx <- 2
             mov     cx,pets.rock            ; cx <- 3
             mov     dx,pets.bird            ; dx <- 0
             int     0x20

   If the enumeration constants are not explicitly initialized, then
they are assigned consecutive integer values starting with zero.
Explicitly and implicitly initialized enumeration constants can be used
within the same enumeration type, in which case an enumeration constant
without an initializer will be assigned the successor of the previous
enumeration constant.

   In this example, the enumeration constants `foo', `bar', and `e' are
implicitly initialized.  A variable of enumeration type `snafu'
therefore takes one of the following integer values: 0 (`foo'), 1
(`bar'), 1 (`a'), 2 (`b'), 4 (`c'), 8 (`d'), or 9 (`e').

     .enum   snafu
             foo
             bar
             a=1
             b=2
             c=4
             d=8
             e
     .ends

4.5 Segment Override Prefixes
=============================

Each prefix directive causes the appropriate instruction prefix byte to
be emitted into the instruction stream.

   Usage:

     prefix
     instruction

where `prefix' can be one of the following:

`.addrsize'
     toggles selection of 16- or 32-bit addressing

     The address size prefix byte (0x67) is emitted--this tells `djasm'
     to interpret the address as either a 32- or a 16-bit value.  For
     instance, it determines whether `di' or `edi' is used as the index
     register for a string instruction.

`.opsize'
     toggles selection of 16- or 32-bit operands

     The data size prefix byte (0x66) is emitted.  This determines the
     size of the operands, distinguishing between `mov ax,bx' and `mov
     eax,ebx', for example.

     The `.addrsize' and `.opsize' opcode prefix bytes are used by
     `djasm' to express the 386's confusing opcode prefix scheme.  For
     backward compatibility with the 8086, instructions have both 16-bit
     and 32-bit forms.  But, their opcodes are identical.  So in a
     32-bit segment the 32-bit forms are used by default, and in 16-bit
     segments the 16-bit forms are used by default.  These prefix bytes
     are used to force the compiler to use the non-default form (e.g.,
     issue a `mov ax,bx' within a 32-bit segment).

`.segcs'
     code segment override

`.segds'
     data segment override

`.seges'
     extra segment override

`.segss'
     stack segment override

`.segfs'
     user segment `f' override

`.seggs'
     user segment `g' override


   The `.seg??' prefixes seem to be most appropriate when used with the
string instructions such as `movs', `stos', etc.).

4.6.4.1 Notes

  1. The mnemonics for the double-precision shifts have changed.  *Note
     Change in Mnemonic Usage: shxd, for additional information.

  2. This mnemonic does not take a `b', `d', or `w' suffix.


Change in Mnemonic Usage
........................

Beginning with the version of `djasm' released with DJGPP v2.04, the
mnemonics `shld' and `shrd' no longer denote Intel's double-precision
shift instructions `SHLD' and `SHRD', respectively.  The correct
mnemonics to use for the double-precision shifts are `dshl' and `dshr'.
Any attempt to write `shld' or `shrd' for a double-precision shift will
generate an error message and the correct mnemonic to use (`dshl' or
`dshr') will be indicated.

   If you are interested, here is the reason for the change.

   The convention in `djasm' is to specify the memory operand size by
appending a `b' (byte), `w' (word), or `d' (double word) suffix to the
mnemonic.  There was one exception, however: in the version of `djasm'
released with DJGPP v2.03, the mnemonics `shld' and `shrd' were used to
denote Intel's double-precision left/right shift instructions.  This
usage was inconsistent with every other instruction that could
reference a byte, word, or double word memory operand (under the
existing convention these mnemonics would be expected to denote left
and right shifts of a double-word memory operand).  However, the
double-precision shifts had been implemented _before_ support was added
for basic shifts of memory operands (at the time, only basic shifts of
register operands had been implemented).

   The cleanest solution was to replace the mnemonics used by `djasm'
for the double-precision shift instructions and reserve `shld' and
`shrd' for basic shifts of a double-word memory operand.  At the time
this change was made (between v2.03 and 2.04) there were no `*.asm'
files in the DJGPP CVS tree that used `shld' or `shrd'.

   It is possible that someone, somewhere, used `shld' or `shrd' to
code for a double-precision shift, but this seems unlikely.  According
to the DJGPP mail archives, these instructions were added by Bill
Currie <bill@taniwha.org>, who soon thereafter recognized the impending
conflict and redefined the mnemonics in his own version of `djasm'.
Unfortunately, his changes did not make it into the stock `djasm.y' at
that time.  Furthermore, documentation for `djasm' has been minimal,
and the only way to know what instructions were supported (and what the
mnemonics were) was to inspect `djasm.y', or to inspect source code
(such as `stub.asm') for `djasm' applications.

5.1 "Hello, world" demo program
===============================

     .type   "com"
     .org    0x100                   ; origin for .COM program

             mov dx, msg             ; point DX to message
             mov ah, 0x9             ; DOS print string function
             int 0x21
             mov ax, 0x4c00          ; DOS exit with errorlevel
             int 0x21
     msg:
             .db "hello, world\r\n$"

   Enter the above code into a file `hello.asm', then make a DOS `.com'
executable using the command

     djasm hello.asm hello.com hello.map

5.2 Examples of enumeration types
=================================

Here are a few examples of using enumeration types in `djasm'.  These
are taken directly from the section on enumeration types (*note
Enumerations::).

  1. Use an enumeration to define a new type, `boolean'.  Load register
     AX with the value `false' and register BX with the value `true'.

          .type   "com"
          .org    0x100
          .enum   boolean
                  false
                  true
          .ends
                  mov     ax,boolean.false
                  mov     bx,boolean.true
                  int     0x20

     If you assemble this program with `djasm',

          djasm.exe bool.asm bool.com bool.map

     and inspect the resulting `.map' file, you will find the following
     enumeration definition:

          Address    Symbols by Value

          0000:0000  __zero__ (?)
          0000:0000  boolean.false (?)
          0000:0001  boolean.true (?)

     If you inspect the assembled code using DOS `debug', you will see
     that the registers are indeed loaded with the proper values:

          % debug bool.exe
          -u 0100 l 08
          1600:0100 B80000        MOV     AX,0000
          1600:0103 BB0100        MOV     BX,0001
          1600:0106 CD20          INT     20
          -q

  2. This example defines an enumeration type `snafu' and demonstrates
     both implicit and explicit initialization of the enumeration
     constants.  In this example, the enumeration constants `foo',
     `bar', and `e' are implicitly initialized with the values 0, 1,
     and 9, respectively.

          .type   "com"
          .org    0x100
          .enum   snafu
                  foo
                  bar
                  a=1
                  b=2
                  c=4
                  d=8
                  e
          .ends
                  int     0x20

     The `.map' file generated by `djasm' shows the enumeration
     constants and how they were defined:

          Address    Symbols by Value

          0000:0000  __zero__ (?)
          0000:0000  snafu.foo (?)
          0000:0001  snafu.a (?)
          0000:0001  snafu.bar (?)
          0000:0002  snafu.b (?)
          0000:0004  snafu.c (?)
          0000:0008  snafu.d (?)
          0000:0009  snafu.e (?)

5.3 Example of opcode prefix usage
==================================

The following code fragment, taken from `stub.asm' in the
`djlsrNNN.zip' archive, illustrates the use of the `.addrsize' and
`.opsize' opcode prefixes.

               :
             [32-bit instructions]
               :
             .addrsize
             rep
             stosd
               :
             [more 16-bit instructions]
               :
             .opsize
             jmpf    fs:[start_eip]          ; start program

   Here, `.addrsize' toggles from the 32-bit addressing mode to the
16-bit mode, and forces the `stosd' instruction to use `di' instead of
`edi' as the index register.  The `.opsize' directive toggles between
16- and 32-bit operand sizes.  In this example it is being used to jump
to a 32-bit address from a 16-bit segment.
