       ggccoovv--ttooooll is an offline tool to process gcc's gcda profile files.

       Current gcov-tool supports the following functionalities:

       *   merge two sets of profiles with weights.

       *   read one set of profile and rewrite profile contents. One can scale
           or normalize the count values.

       Examples of the use cases for this tool are:

       *   Collect the profiles for different set of inputs, and use this tool
           to merge them. One can specify the weight to factor in the relative
           importance of each input.

       *   Rewrite the profile after removing a subset of the gcda files,
           while maintaining the consistency of the summary and the histogram.

       *   It can also be used to debug or libgcov code as the tools shares
           the majority code as the runtime library.

       Note that for the merging operation, this profile generated offline may
       contain slight different values from the online merged profile. Here
       are a list of typical differences:

       *   histogram difference: This offline tool recomputes the histogram
           after merging the counters. The resulting histogram, therefore, is
           precise. The online merging does not have this capability -- the
           histogram is merged from two histograms and the result is an
           approximation.

       *   summary checksum difference: Summary checksum uses a CRC32
           operation. The value depends on the link list order of gcov-info
           objects. This order is different in gcov-tool from that in the
           online merge. It's expected to have different summary checksums. It
           does not really matter as the compiler does not use this checksum
           anywhere.

       *   value profile counter values difference: Some counter values for
           value profile are runtime dependent, like heap addresses. It's
           normal to see some difference in these kind of counters.

           Compute the overlap score between the two specified profile
           directories.  The overlap score is computed based on the arc
           profiles. It is defined as the sum of min (p1_counter[i] /
           p1_sum_all, p2_counter[i] / p2_sum_all), for all arc counter i,
           where p1_counter[i] and p2_counter[i] are two matched counters and
           p1_sum_all and p2_sum_all are the sum of counter values in profile
           1 and profile 2, respectively.
